# Analog_watch
In this project, we will learn how to design and implement an analog clock with sound using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- To start, we’ll create the basic HTML structure for our analog clock.
- Next, we’ll style our analog clock using CSS. We’ll also import the Google Fonts “Poppins” so that the fonts look nicer.
- Now it’s time to make our analog clock functional using JavaScript. We’ll use JavaScript to update the position of the clock needles based on the current time. To make our analog clock more engaging, we can add sound effects to indicate the ticking of the clock.
